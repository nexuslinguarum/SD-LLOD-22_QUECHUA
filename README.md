## Words without translations in other languages
Words and their translation into English. The diagram indicates that both the lower whisker and the first quartile agglutinate the same set of words. This implies that 50% of the words are translated with 3 or 4 English words. The second quartile shows that, of the remaining words, 25% are defined by 4 to 6 English words. The last quartile shows that the last set of words, 25%, is defined with 6 to 10 English words. 

However, one of the most striking features is the large number of outliers. Especially the word that has 54 words to be defined "sach'a mama". The translation is as follows: spirit mother of the jungle in form of a mythical huge eared boa believed to dwell in the same place for a very long time. Vegetation grows on its body and makes the snake easily be mistaken by a fallen tree. He may devour the unaware hunter who has accidentally stepped on its body.
